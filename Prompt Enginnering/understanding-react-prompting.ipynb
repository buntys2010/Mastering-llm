However, a significant challenge has been the separation of reasoning and action in these models. This code is explained in below blog to discusses how ReAct Prompting bridges this gap and transforms the way LLMs function.\n","\n","[Read the full blog here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mastering-react-prompting-crucial-step/) üìñüîó\n","\n","## Understanding ReAct Prompting ü§ñüß†\n","\n","ReAct Prompting is an innovative approach that harnesses LLMs to generate reasoning and task-specific actions in an intertwined way. Think of it as a conductor guiding an orchestra ‚Äì it harmonizes reasoning and action for a seamless performance.\n","\n","## Why ReAct Prompting Matters üåü\n","\n","ReAct Prompting is a game-changer because it unlocks synergy between reasoning and action. Imagine planning a road trip: you need a map (reasoning) and a steering wheel (action). ReAct Prompting combines these elements, ensuring clear direction and adaptability in AI. Here's why it's crucial:\n","\n","1. **Synergy between Reasoning and Action:** Like a map guides your route and a steering wheel your vehicle, ReAct Prompting synchronizes reasoning and action, empowering LLMs to adapt and handle exceptions.\n","\n","2. **Enhanced Interactivity with External Sources:** It lets LLMs interact with knowledge bases like pit stops on a journey, enhancing information gathering.\n","\n","3. **Improved Human Interpretability and Trustworthiness:** ReAct Prompting generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are both effective and trustworthy.\n","\n","4. **Superior Decision-Making:** It excels in decision-making, outperforming traditional methods by a wide margin.\n","\n","In essence, ReAct Prompting is the GPS for LLMs in navigating the complex world of language understanding and decision-making. The blog promises to delve deeper into its applications, impacts on various tasks, and the exciting prospects it offers for the future of AI.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-04T09:21:31.898205Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-04T09:21:31.897630Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-04T09:21:48.667051Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-04T09:21:48.665895Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-04T09:21:31.898160Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install openai"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-04T09:22:21.707643Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-04T09:22:21.707192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-04T09:22:30.760008Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-04T09:22:30.757846Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-04T09:22:21.707600Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import openai\n","from getpass import getpass\n","openai.api_key = getpass()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Lets try default model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-04T10:47:05.586082Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-04T10:47:05.584552Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.699288Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.698055Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-04T10:47:05.586028Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import openai\n","\n","response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n","  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n","  messages=[\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n","        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"\"\"Author David Chanoff has collaborated with a U.S. Navy admiral who served as the ambassador to the United Kingdom under which President?\n","         \"\"\"}\n","    ],\n","    temperature=0\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.702175Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.701383Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.708850Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.707842Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-04T10:47:06.702133Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Lets try CoT"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-04T10:47:41.286987Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-04T10:47:41.286465Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-04T10:47:43.304605Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-04T10:47:43.303468Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-04T10:47:41.286945Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import openai\n","\n","response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n","  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n","  messages=[\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n","        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Author David Chanoff has collaborated with a U.S. Navy admiral who served as the ambassador to the United Kingdom under which President?
